# Oneshot For Wii
A Port of the Freeware (2014) Ver. of Oneshot for the Wii. Thanks to derric young for giving the idea to me after he had problems himself to get it to work on his wii.

Here's how to get Oneshot to Work on your Wii: First of all you need to have a Modded Wii with Homebrew or else it wont work.

1. download EasyRPG Wii by going to the main site: https://easyrpg.org/player/downloads/ tab on "other" at the 0.7.0 "Sword" version and download "Wii (.dol)"
2. download the Oneshot folder in the release tab.
3. extract the EasyRPG_Player-0.7.0-Wii.zip file and add it in the "apps" folder if it exists
4. add the Oneshot Wii Build in the same folder as easyRPG's "Boot.dol" file (that should be in EasyRPG's folder)
5. open up EasyRPG in Homebrew and if you see Oneshot, congrats! you can now play oneshot on your Wii!
Have fun!!!
